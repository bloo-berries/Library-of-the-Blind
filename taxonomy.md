# Taxonomy and Counting Methodology

This document outlines the taxonomy and counting methodology for the Library of the Blind. When submitting records or counting entries, use this structure to ensure consistency and comprehensiveness.

## Counting Rules

**Key Principle:** Each distinct system counts as a separate entry because it requires its own translation tables, teaching materials, and publishing pipelines.

## Taxonomy Structure

| Category | Sub-category (example) | Counting Unit |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Spoken Languages** | English, Mandarin, Swahili, ... | 1 per language that has at least one accessibility pipeline (screen-reader localization, Braille translation, audio-book production) |
| **Braille Codes** | Unified English Braille, Arabic Braille, Hindi Braille, ... | 1 per distinct Braille code (including music, math, computer Braille) |
| **Alternative Tactile Scripts** | Moon Type, Pro-Tactile, New York Point, ... | 1 per script |
| **Audio Communication Channels** | Screen reader (English), Audio description (French), Audiobook (Japanese), ... | 1 per language-channel combination (e.g., "Spanish screen-reader output") |
| **Tactile/Haptic Modalities** | Refreshable Braille display (English), 3-D printed models (German), Tactile graphics (Arabic), ... | 1 per language-modality pair |
| **Multimodal Systems** | Screen-reader + Braille (English), Pro-Tactile + STT (American Sign Language), ... | 1 per unique pairing |

## Special Categories

### Multimodal Systems
- **Count:** 1 per unique pairing
- **Examples:** 
  - Screen-reader + Braille (English)
  - Pro-Tactile + STT (American Sign Language)

### Indigenous / Minority Scripts
- **Count:** 1 per script
- **Examples:** 
  - Māori Braille
  - Inuktitut Braille
  - Zulu Braille

### Constructed / Niche Languages
- **Count:** 1 per script
- **Examples:** 
  - Esperanto Braille
  - Klingon Braille

## Notes

- Each distinct Braille code counts as a separate "language entry" because it requires its own translation tables, teaching materials, and publishing pipelines.
- Regional variants of the same base system (e.g., Portuguese Braille PT-BR vs PT-PT) may be counted separately if they have significant differences.
- Historical systems (e.g., New York Point) are included for completeness and historical reference.
