# Multimodal Systems

Systems that combine multiple accessibility technologies to provide comprehensive access to information.

## Definition

Multimodal systems pair different accessibility technologies together, creating unique combinations that serve specific needs or use cases.

## Examples

### Screen-Reader + Braille
- **Languages:** English, French, German, Spanish, and many others
- **Description:** Combines synthesized speech output with refreshable Braille display
- **Use Cases:**
  - Learning Braille while hearing the text
  - Verifying pronunciation
  - Multitasking (listening while reading)
- **Examples:**
  - JAWS + Focus 40 Braille display (English)
  - NVDA + Orbit Reader (multiple languages)
  - VoiceOver + Braille display (Apple ecosystem)

### Pro-Tactile + Speech-to-Text (STT)
- **Languages:** American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and other sign languages
- **Description:** Combines Pro-Tactile communication with speech-to-text transcription
- **Use Cases:**
  - DeafBlind individuals accessing spoken content
  - Real-time communication support
- **Status:** Emerging technology

### Audio Description + Tactile Graphics
- **Languages:** Multiple
- **Description:** Combines spoken descriptions with tactile representations
- **Use Cases:**
  - Understanding complex visual information
  - Educational content
  - Museum exhibits
- **Examples:**
  - Museum tours with audio guides and tactile models
  - Educational materials with both audio and tactile components

### Braille + Large Print + Audio
- **Languages:** Multiple
- **Description:** Triple-modality approach for maximum accessibility
- **Use Cases:**
  - Educational settings
  - Public information displays
  - Comprehensive accessibility compliance

### Screen Reader + Magnification + Braille
- **Languages:** Multiple
- **Description:** Combines visual, auditory, and tactile access
- **Use Cases:**
  - Low vision users who also use screen readers
  - Transitioning between modalities
  - Comprehensive access solutions

## Talking-Touch Devices

Portable devices that integrate multiple modalities:

### BrailleSense
- **Modalities:** Braille display + Speech + Touch screen
- **Languages:** Multiple
- **Description:** Portable computing with combined Braille display and speech

### BrailleNote Touch
- **Modalities:** Braille display + Speech + Touch screen
- **Languages:** Multiple
- **Description:** Integrated TTS + Braille refreshable display

## Counting Methodology

**1 per unique pairing**

Examples:
- "Screen-reader + Braille (English)" = 1 entry
- "Pro-Tactile + STT (American Sign Language)" = 1 entry
- "Audio description + Tactile graphics (French)" = 1 entry

## Notes

- Multimodal systems provide redundancy and flexibility
- Different combinations serve different needs
- Some users prefer multiple modalities simultaneously
- Technology integration continues to evolve
- Standards for multimodal systems are still developing

## Future Directions

- AI-powered multimodal systems
- More seamless integration between modalities
- Customizable modality combinations
- Cloud-based multimodal services
