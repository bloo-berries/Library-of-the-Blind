- **Orbit Research:** Orbit Reader, various models
- **And many others...**

## Talking-Touch Devices

Portable computing devices that combine Braille display and speech output.

### Examples
- **BrailleSense:** Portable device with combined Braille display and speech
- **BrailleNote Touch:** Portable computing with combined Braille display and speech
- **Key Features:**
  - Integrated TTS + Braille refreshable display
  - Portable computing capabilities
  - Standalone devices (not just displays)

## 3D Printed Models

Three-dimensional tactile representations of objects, diagrams, and concepts.

### Applications
- **Anatomical models:** For medical education
- **Architectural models:** For understanding building layouts
- **Scientific models:** Molecules, cells, geological formations
- **Mathematical models:** Geometric shapes, graphs
- **Art reproductions:** Sculptures, paintings (tactile versions)

### By Language/Region
- **English:** Extensive use in education and museums
- **German:** Growing use in educational institutions
- **French:** Used in museums and schools
- **Arabic:** Emerging use
- **Japanese:** Used in museums and education
- **And many more...**

## Tactile Graphics

Raised-line diagrams, maps, and illustrations that can be felt.

### Types
- **Embossed diagrams:** Created using embossing machines
- **Swell paper graphics:** Heat-raised graphics
- **Vacuum-formed graphics:** 3D-like raised graphics
- **Graphic Braille:** Combination of Braille text and tactile graphics

### Applications
- **Maps:** Geographic, street, building layouts
- **Charts and graphs:** Statistical data visualization
- **Diagrams:** Flowcharts, organizational charts
- **Scientific illustrations:** Biological, chemical, physical diagrams
- **Art:** Tactile art reproductions

### Standards
- **ISO 13125:** Tactile map symbols (standardized symbols for roads, water, elevation, etc.)
- **Various national standards:** For tactile graphics production

## Embossed Diagrams

Physical raised-line graphics created through embossing.

### Production Methods
- **Embossing machines:** Create raised lines on paper
- **Swell paper:** Heat-activated paper that raises when printed on
- **Vacuum forming:** Creates 3D-like raised surfaces

## Experimental and Technological Systems

Advanced tactile technologies that use alternative methods to convey information through touch.

### Vibrotactile Alphabets
- **Origin / Users:** Various (1960s–present)
- **Description:** Patterns of vibration on skin representing letters; used in wearable devices
- **Status:** <span style="color: green;">Active</span> (research and development)
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses vibration patterns on skin
  - Can be integrated into wearable devices
  - Represents letters through tactile vibration
  - Research ongoing for various applications

### Optacon Letter Recognition
- **Origin / Users:** USA (1970s–1990s)
- **Description:** Camera converts print to vibrating pin array felt by fingertip
- **Status:** Historical/obsolete (discontinued)
- **Key Features:**
  - Camera-based print recognition
  - Converts print to tactile vibration
  - Portable device with vibrating pin array
  - Important historical technology

### Electrotactile Displays
- **Origin / Users:** Research (1980s–present)
- **Description:** Electrical stimulation patterns representing text
- **Status:** Research/experimental
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses electrical stimulation
  - Patterns represent text
  - Ongoing research
  - Potential for future applications

## Counting Methodology

**1 per language-modality pair**

Examples:
- "Refreshable Braille display (English)" = 1 entry
- "3-D printed models (German)" = 1 entry
- "Tactile graphics (Arabic)" = 1 entry

## Notes

- Refreshable Braille displays are essential for digital Braille access
- Talking-touch devices combine multiple modalities
- 3D models make abstract concepts tangible
- Tactile graphics provide access to visual information
- Standards like ISO 13125 ensure consistency in tactile representations
