# Specialized Braille Systems

Specialized Braille codes designed for specific domains beyond literary text.

## Music Braille

### Braille Music Notation
- **Inventor/Developer:** Louis Braille
- **Origin / Users:** International
- **Date:** 1829-present
- **Description:** Louis Braille's original music notation system. Uses the same six-position braille cell as literary braille, but assigns its own meanings and has its own syntax and abbreviations. Almost anything that can be written in print music notation can be written in braille music notation. The system is designed to ease memorization of scores, as blind musicians may need both hands to play their instrument. The world's largest collection of braille music notation is at the Library of Congress in the United States.
- **Status:** <span style="color: green;">Active</span> standard
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses six-dot cells with independent syntax from literary Braille
  - Notes aligned with solfège system (C = 'd' for "do", D = 'e', E = 'f', F = 'g', G = 'h', A = 'i', B = 'j')
  - Rhythm indicated by dots 3 and 6: eighth notes (no dot 3 or 6), quarter notes (dot 6), half notes (dot 3), whole notes (dots 3,6)
  - Octave marks specify octave ranges (4th octave starts at middle C)
  - No clef symbols required (octave marks replace them)
  - Represents notes, rhythms, dynamics, accidentals, tempo markings, and other musical elements
  - Musical markings (crescendo, diminuendo, etc.) preceded by "word sign" (dots 3,4,5)
  - Supports chords, intervals, and contrapuntal lines
  - Available from National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS) in the US and similar national libraries worldwide
  - Can be transcribed manually or using software like Goodfeel, BrailleMUSE, or Sao Mai Braille
