# Library of the Blind

A comprehensive, open-source repository documenting the most extensive collection of blind and visually impaired communication methodologies, systems, and accessibility technologies from around the world.

## Overview

This library serves as a centralized, easily accessible reference for:

- **Braille systems** across languages and regions
- **Alternative tactile scripts** (Moon Type, Pro-Tactile, etc.)
- **Specialized Braille codes** (Music, Mathematics, Computer Braille)
- **Audio communication channels** (Screen readers, audiobooks, audio descriptions)
- **Tactile and haptic modalities** (Refreshable Braille displays, 3D models, tactile graphics)
- **Multimodal systems** combining multiple accessibility technologies
- **Regional accessibility infrastructure** and standards

## Categories

### 1. Spoken Languages

Languages that have at least one accessibility pipeline (screen-reader localization, Braille translation, audio-book production).

### 2. Braille Codes

Distinct Braille codes including:

- Literary Braille (language-specific)
- Music Braille
- Mathematics Braille (Nemeth Code, etc.)
- Computer Braille (CBC)

### 3. Alternative Tactile Scripts

Non-Braille tactile writing systems:

- Moon Type
- New York Point (historical)
- Pro-Tactile (PT)
- Other specialized systems

### 4. Audio Communication Channels

- Screen reader outputs by language
- Audio descriptions
- Audiobook production
- Text-to-speech systems

### 5. Tactile/Haptic Modalities

- Refreshable Braille displays
- 3D printed models
- Tactile graphics
- Embossed diagrams

### 6. Multimodal Systems

Unique pairings of accessibility technologies (e.g., Screen-reader + Braille, Pro-Tactile + STT)

## Contributing

This is an open-source project. Contributions, corrections, and additions are welcome. Please see our contributing guidelines (to be added).

## Counting Methodology

Each distinct system counts as a separate entry because it requires:

- Its own translation tables
- Teaching materials
- Publishing pipelines
- Community support infrastructure

See [taxonomy.md](./taxonomy.md) for detailed counting rules.
