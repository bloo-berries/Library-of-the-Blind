Quadoo is easy to read, since the characters can be assigned to Latin letters without any problems and without any confusion. It is also easy to write with a square stencil, since there are no arcs, circles or the like. Only the four sides and the two diagonals of a square are used to represent all characters. This means that the characters only consist of 1 to 6 lines and possibly additional dots at the corners to represent special characters. It was designed for handwritten notes by blind people and can also be used outdoors with materials like twigs, nails, or matches

## Ancient and Historical Tactile Systems

### Didymus the Blind's Carved Wooden Letters
- **Inventor/Developer:** [Didymus the Blind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didymus_the_Blind)
- **Origin:** Alexandria, Egypt
- **Date:** 4th Century CE (c. 313-398 CE)
- **Description:** Didymus the Blind began his education by using a system which was remarkably like Braille, that is reading letters engraved into the surface of wood by touch and subsequently furthering his knowledge by listening. Despite his blindness, Didymus excelled in scholarship because of his incredible memory. He found ways to help blind people to read, experimenting with carved wooden letters similar to Braille systems used by the blind today. This represents the earliest documented individual tactile reading system—predating Braille by approximately 1,500 years. Didymus, blinded by ophthalmia at age four, became one of the most learned theologians of his era and taught Saint Jerome.
- **Status:** Historical
- **Key Features:**
  - Letters engraved into the surface of wood
  - Read by touch
  - Earliest documented individual tactile reading system
  - Predates Braille by approximately 1,500 years
  - Used by one of the most learned theologians of the 4th century

### Japanese Anma/Amma Tradition
- **Origin:** Japan
- **Date:** 1600s–Present
- **Description:** [Anma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anma) is a practice of traditional Japanese massage. During the Tokugawa period, edicts were passed which made the practice of anma solely the preserve of the blind—sighted people were prohibited from practicing the art. Blind practitioners dominated anma due to the tactile nature of the techniques, which relied on heightened sensitivity to bodily cues rather than sight. In contemporary Japan, anma continues to underpin vocational training and employment for the visually impaired, with specialized curricula integrated into schools for the blind since the Meiji era's establishment of such institutions in the 1870s. This represents a unique case where tactile expertise became legally exclusive to blind practitioners, transforming heightened tactile sensitivity into professional advantage and creating an entire occupational identity around blindness.
- **Status:** <span style="color: green;">Active</span>

### Quipu / Khipu
- **Origin / Users:** Andean Civilizations
- **Date:** 2600 BCE–present
- **Description:** It is generally thought that the system did not include phonetic symbols analogous to letters of the alphabet. However, Gary Urton has suggested that the quipus used a binary system which could record phonological or logographic data. Another theory is that this is at least partially a tactile writing system, as fibers used in Quipu can be differentiated by touch. Quipu could record dates, statistics, accounts, and even abstract ideas. Quipu are still used today across South America. According to Guaman Poma, quipucamayocs could "read" the quipus with their eyes closed. Recent research has found that some quipus are special. Because they're logosyllabic. Meaning the knots and the differences in fibers corresponded to phonetic sounds, which formed words
- **Status:** <span style="color: green;">Active</span> (still used in South America)
- **Key Features:**
  - Knot-based recording system

- Many niche systems exist for specific populations (late-blind adults, children with multiple disabilities, DeafBlind individuals)
- Regional variation is significant (Lorm in German-speaking countries, Canaan Barrie in Scotland, Social Haptics in Scandinavia)
