# Alternative Tactile Scripts (Non-Braille)

Some blind users prefer or require scripts that differ from traditional Braille. These are also legitimate entries for an inclusive library.

## Scripts

### Moon Type
- **Origin / Users:** Invented by William Moon (1849) - used mainly in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand

- **Status:** Active (though less common than Braille)
- **Key Features:**
  - Characters are simplified versions of print letters
  - Easier to learn for those who lose sight later in life
  - Particularly useful for people with reduced tactile sensitivity

### New York Point
- **Origin / Users:** 19th-century U.S. system (now obsolete)
- **Description:** Two-column, 10-dot system; historically used in early American blind schools
- **Status:** Historical/obsolete
- **Key Features:**
  - Historical significance in American blind education
  - Replaced by standard Braille
  - Important for understanding the evolution of tactile scripts

### Pro-Tactile (PT)
- **Origin / Users:** Developed by DeafBlind community (USA, Canada, Europe)
- **Description:** A tactile-sign language that conveys grammatical information through pressure, movement, and location on the hand
- **Status:** Active

- Pro-Tactile is particularly important for the DeafBlind community
- Moon Type remains in use, especially for those who lose sight later in life
